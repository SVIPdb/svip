#Gene page

The Gene page is dedicated to gene information and includes a list of associated variants. It provides the official gene name (HGNC) and cross-references to NCBI Gene (Entrez Gene), Ensembl Gene and UniProtKB databases. If at least one gene variant has been manually annotated, a brief summary describes what is the physiological function of the gene and its involvement in cancer. Finally, a list of genetic variants reported for this gene is provided, according to their position on the chromosome. The genetic variants can be uploaded into SVIP by a SVIP partner, or they can come from other public sources. As of today, SVIP harvests data from OncoKB, CIViC or ClinVar. A “show only SVIP variants” tick box allows limiting the list of genetic variants to those having SVIP data, meaning that they have been observed in at least one patient in Switzerland. A click on “Show Details” opens the page dedicated to the variant of interest.
