In this section, we report the identification of a variant in a given tumor type, based on the literature.

Disease	|All ICD-O codes|International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O)



##Biological relevance			

In this section, we report the effect of variants on protein/transcript expression, protein function, interaction with other proteins/compounds and response to drugs, based on the literature. This section only contains evidences from laboratory studies, performed either in vitro or in animals. All reported data are manually annotated from scientific/medical publications or, in rare cases, manually reviewed predictions.

##Complementary information	
All SVIP curation evidences described above in both "Clinical significance" and "Biological relevance" can be completed with notes, which provide a very brief summary, in free text, of the published data, including limitations or caveats (such as a number of patients in the study, completeness of the variant description, etc.). This allows users to understand the weight attributed to the various evidences.

Excluded 			
This section reports publications that have been excluded from the annotation pipeline, such as, for instance, publications that do not deal with the exact variant described in a given SVIP entry.
