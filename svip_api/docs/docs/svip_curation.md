## Evidence type

Evidence type based on the potential clinical actionability of the variant in a given disease.

Evidence type based on the potential clinical actionability or the pathogenicity of the variant in a given disease.

### Example Evidence type

`Prognostic`

## Effect

Consequence of the variant observed during a clinical or functional investigation.

Consequence of the variant observed during a clinical or functional investigation.

### Example Effect

`Poor outcome`

## Drug

Drug or combination of drugs

Drug or combination of drugs used during a therapy

### Example Drug

`Verumafenib`

### Drug reference

## Tier Criteria

Level of pathogenicity or actionability of a variant as defined by AMP/ASCO/CAPS guidelines
