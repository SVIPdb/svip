The patient underwent surgery, followed in most cases by radiotherapy. During a median 62 month follow-up period, 51 patients relapsed, 1 with a wild-type CTNNB1 tumor and 50 with  mutated CTNNB1. The 5-year recurrence-free survival was significantly shorter in all mutated CTNNB1 tumors, including T41A, compared with wild-type tumors, but this poor outcome could not be related to a specific genotype, as there was no significant difference between T41A, S45F, or S45P mutants."

CTNNB1 mutations and APC mutations appear to be mutually exclusive in DF, thus, detection of a somatic CTNNB1 mutation may help to exclude a syndromal condition. Vice versa, CTNNB1 wild-type status in DF should raise suspicion for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), with more extensive diagnostic clinical work-up (e.g. colonoscopy). Mutation analysis of CTNNB1 has been proposed as a specific diagnostic tool for establishing DF diagnosis, particularly in challenging or diagnostically ambiguous cases (recommendation issued  by the European Consensus Initiative between Sarcoma PAtients EuroNet (SPAEN) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)/Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group (STBSG)).'
