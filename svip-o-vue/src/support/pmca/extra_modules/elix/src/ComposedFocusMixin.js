/**
 * Normalizes focus treatment for custom elements with Shadow DOM
 *
 * This mixin exists for two reasons:
 *
 * 1. The default behavior for mousedown should set the focus to the closest
 *    ancestor of the clicked element that can take the focus. As of Nov 2018,
 *    Chrome and Safari don't handle this as expected when the clicked element
 *    is reassigned across more than one slot to end up inside a focusable
 *    element. In such cases, the focus will end up on the body. Firefox
 *    exhibits the behavior we want. See
 *    https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/773.
 *
 * 2. Components may have interactive subelements that should not take the
 *    focus, but instead keep the focus on the component host or a designated
 *    subelement. E.g., a [ComboBox](ComboBox) has an arrow button that can be
 *    clicked to toggle the opened/closed state of the popup. Pressing that
 *    button would normally give that button the focus, even if the button
 *    has `tabindex` of -1. However, the `ComboBox` wants to keep the focus on
 *    the combo box's input element.
 *
 * For point #1, this mixin normalizes behavior to provide what Firefox does.
 * When the user mouses down inside anywhere inside the component's light DOM or
 * Shadow DOM, we walk up the composed tree to find the first element that can
 * take the focus and put the focus on it.
 *
 * The above behavior also helps address point #2. In the `ComboBox` example,
 * when the arrow button is pressed, the focus will not be given to the button,
 * but rather to the combo box. The combo box defines a symbol,
 * [symbols.focusTarget](symbols#focusTarget), which specifies that the combo
 * box's input element should be given the focus.
